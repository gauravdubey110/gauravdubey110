- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gauravdubey110

I'm really passionate about building innovative and useful tech products that could solve some real world problems. Being really curious about new things and implementing by making projects, I have created several small or big projects using frameworks/libraries such as React JS(with Redux), Node JS/Express JS, MongoDB(with Mongoose), Material UI, Azure services along with a lot of other useful relevant frameworks and tools like Postman, Git and GitHub, etc. 
I've also worked with RESTful APIs along with JWT authentication and payment gateway integration(Stripe). 
One more important skill that I possess and would like to mention is having good googling skills which is very essential for every developer nowadays. Apart from this, I have decent knowledge about CS fundamentals such as DBMS, SDLC principles, OS concepts, CI/CD, etc. which I do keep in mind while building any project. 
I'm proficient in programming languages such as C++(with STL), Python, and JavaScript. Not only I build things locally, I really love to work with cloud technologies where I use Azure and Amazon resources such as EC2/VM, Database solutions, Serverless functions, Blob storage, etc. for my projects. 
So, I would love to work with the organisation and give my full potential to accomplish the tasks.
